###### Basketball
**Basketball** is a team sport in which two teams of **five** players each attempt to score points against the other by launching a ball through a 300 cm high **hoop**.Both indoor and outdoor courts are used to play it. I really enjoy this sport because of the exciting competition between the two teams.
